# Scatterplot Aesthetic Configuration
Contains the settings for formatting the points on the SPC chart.

![Padding](images\scatterSettings.png)

- **Dot Size** - Size for each point in the SPC (default is 2.5)
- **Colour** - The colour for each point in the SPC (default is black)
- **Opacity** - The opacity for each point (default is 1)
- **Opacity if Unselected** - The opacity for the points that are not highlighted (default is 0.2)

Each of the above settings can also be configured using conditional formatting, allowing for different dot sizes, colours and opacities. Colour should be set using the hex colour code.
