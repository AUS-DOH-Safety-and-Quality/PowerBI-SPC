# Free and Open-Source Process Control for PowerBI

This repository contains a free PowerBI custom visual for you to create Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts. The visual has been developed by the Safety and Quality team at the West Australian Health Department's Healthcare Quality Intelligence Unit. If you'd like more detail on SPC we recommend the [NHS Making Data Count guide]([url](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/making-data-count/)).

The visual is implemented purely within PowerBI and has no dependencies on external programs like R or Python. The visual supports hover-over-tooltips as well as cross-plot filtering and highlighting.

The visual can be installed from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/healthdepartmentwa1667894240640.powerbi-spc-charts?tab=Overview). For the latest development release, see the Installation page.
