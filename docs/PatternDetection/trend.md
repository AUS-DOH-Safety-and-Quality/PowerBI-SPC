# Trends
A trend is defined as five or more consecutive points all going up or all going down, inclusive of the first data point that starts the trend. If the value of two or more consecutive points are the same, all points are included in the trend.

The SPC visual defaults this to a minimum of five points, however this can be adjusted in the data settings.
