# Assurance Types
Assurance icons analyses the consistency in being able to hit the target set for the chosen measure. There are three icons:

| Icon | Definition |
| -- | -- |
| ![Assurance Hit Or Miss](images\AssuranceIconHitOrMiss.png) | Variation indicates **inconsistently** hitting, passing and falling short of the target. This means that the target may sometimes be met and sometimes missed due to random variation. |
| ![Assurance Pass](images\AssuranceIconPass.png) | Variation indicates consistently **(P)assing** the target. |
| ![Assurance Fail](images\AssuranceIconFail.png) | Variation indicators consistently **(F)alling short** of the target. |
